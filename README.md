# StoneTEKK Contact Picker App

The **StoneTEKK Contact Picker App** simplifies the process of managing retailer orders for dealers in the stone management industry. Designed specifically for dealers interacting with retailers outside the StoneTEKK ecosystem, the app leverages the **Contact Picker API** to streamline onboarding retailer details and enhance user experience.

## Use Case

### The Problem

1. Retailers who are not part of the StoneTEKK ecosystem frequently place recurring stone orders with dealers.
2. Dealers previously had to manually fill out forms with retailer details such as name, address, and phone number, leading to frustration and inefficiency.
3. Existing autofill features were limited to the dealerâ€™s saved addresses, offering little help for entering retailer information.

### The Solution

Using the **Contact Picker API**, the app enables dealers to:

1. Quickly import retailer details (name, phone number, address, and even profile pictures) directly from their phone's contact list.
2. Save retailer information in the app's centralized state (using Redux Toolkit) for the current session without permanently storing it on servers, ensuring privacy.
3. Add multiple retailers at once to a new order without repetitive form-filling.
4. Easily specify recurring monthly orders for those retailers.
5. Send orders with just a few clicks, and automatically:
   - Clear retailer details from the app to maintain privacy.
   - Email retailers with their order details, including delivery name and address.
   - Reduce friction for retailers not currently in the StoneTEKK ecosystem as well as increase the chances to onboard New retailers with every mail sent.

This time-saving feature improves the dealer's workflow, providing a modernized approach to managing orders for retailers who are not yet onboarded onto StoneTEKK.

## App UI

The supported vendor for Contact Picker is android, where our UI is minimal as well as secure, the Dealer can see the people and emails he's adding to send orders and he doesn't have to fill the form multiple times for Retailers not on our System with same recurring order requests.

## Fallback UI

For vendors not supporting the Contact Picker API, the fallback is a form with autofill. While this is fully supported, it's a slow process and affects our conversion rates.

Even though Chrome has a support for Contact Picker API, iOS lacks a dedicated UI at the time of writing, making Contact Picker not work on iOS devices.

## Email UI

The email UI sent to retailers when orders are sent using Contact Picker API. For us retailers not on our Stone Management system have been proven to get onboarded 70% faster by this API which has potential to help million dollar businesses by reducing times (for us in the stone industry).

## About the Contact Picker API

The **Contact Picker API** is a modern web standard that allows users to select contacts from their device's address book directly within a web application.

### Key Features:

- **Privacy-Focused**: Users grant explicit consent to share contact details, and the app cannot access the entire address book.
- **Efficient**: Simplifies importing contact details, eliminating manual data entry.
- **Compatibility**: Currently, the API is experimental and supported only on Chrome in Android. Ensure your browser supports the API before use.

### Limitations:

- **Browser Support**: Not all browsers support the Contact Picker API, so fallback mechanisms may be necessary.
- **Mobile Devices**: Primarily designed for use on mobile devices where contacts are readily available.

Despite these limitations, the Contact Picker API is a game-changer for applications requiring contact selection, like this app.
